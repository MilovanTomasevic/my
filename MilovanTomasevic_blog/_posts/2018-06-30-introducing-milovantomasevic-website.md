Milovan Toma≈°eviƒá website offers you various options. Selection and processing of sites, business creations, various education that will help you to improve, and learn new skills. As it offers education, it also serves to exchange a variety of experiences. I hope this website will serve as an example and as an opportunity to show myself  to an audience that won‚Äôt be unknown for too long.


### Cover Pages

The new design doubles down on MilovanTomasevic Website as your personal site. The new Cover Pages let visitors know what you're about at a glance, showing your logo or profile picture, tagline or description, and selection of social media icons.

### Lazy-Loading Images

Using lots of images can severely impact the performance of a site. It can also cause layout quirks when images pop into existence.
In MilovanTomasevic Website you have the option to provide `width` and `height` information for your images and let MilovanTomasevic Website lazy-load them as readers scroll the page.

### Better Blog Layout

The `blog` layout finally catches up to modern design standards and renders a posts's `image` as part of the preview, giving it a tastier look that makes visitors more likely to engage.
