My name is [***Milovan Tomašević***](/resume/) and I work on [**_HPC RIVR project_**](MilovanTomasevic_blog/_posts/2018-12-23-High-Performance-Computing-Center-in-Slovenia-HPC-RIVR.md){:target="_blank"} as a [**_HPC (High Performance Computing) Consultant_**](https://www.fis.unm.si/si/o-fakulteti/sodelavci/strokovni-sodelavci/){:target="_blank"} at the [**_Faculty of Information Studies in Novo mesto, Slovenia_**](https://www.fis.unm.si/en/){:target="_blank"}. I am from _Serbia_ and I worked at the [_Faculty of Technical Sciences, Novi Sad University_, Serbia](http://www.ftn.uns.ac.rs/n1386094394/faculty-of-technical-sciences){:target="_blank"}, as a researcher for six years. And I worked as an iOS Developer (that is, I developed applications for I-device) at a company working on the development of Internet of Things, also known as Industry 4.0.

I obtained a [*Ph.D.*](courses/fis/PhDfis.html#1){:target="_blank"} in *Industrial Engineering* at the same faculty, with a dissertation paper called [*''Adaptive Model for Supply Chains Management in Small and Medium Enterprises''*](http://nardus.mpn.gov.rs/handle/123456789/9234){:target="_blank"} (as well as an *MSc* in *Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management* and an *MSc* in *Computer Sciences*).

> Something else, my education isn't the end, I'm currently working on my **_second doctorate_**, which is focused on **_Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) for High Performance Computing (HPC)_**.

My main areas of interest are:

*   **_[Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) for High Performance Computing (HPC)](/courses/#table-of-contents)_**,
*   Supply Chain Management Systems with HPC,
*   Business Process Management,
*   IT Service Management, and Project Management.

I moved to Slovenia only a month ago and I am currently employed at the [*Faculty of Information Studies in Novo mesto*](https://www.fis.unm.si/si/o-fakulteti/sodelavci/strokovni-sodelavci/){:target="_blank"}, where I specialize in the use of *HPC* in industry.
