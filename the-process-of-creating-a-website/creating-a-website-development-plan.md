After collecting information in the first step, the development of a website development plan is in order. 
This is the starting point for the development of the site map. The site map provides a list of the most important areas of the website, as well as sub-sections, if needed. 

This document contains content display for the website and is essential for the development of a consistent, simple navigation system. When preparing this document, you have to have visitors in your mind - site users. 
They are the ones who will take advantage of the entire web system - navigation, design and content - and read the content you want or buy a product.

Elements such as interactive forms, shopping maps, flash animations, etc., are parts that are planned at this stage.
