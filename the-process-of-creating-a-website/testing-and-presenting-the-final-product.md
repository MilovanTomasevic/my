As part of this step, web designers and managers finalize details and test the entire website. Testing refers to the complete functionality of links, forms, scripts, and compatibility testing (differences between Internet browsers), allowing the website to be optimized for display in all browsers and on all graphical resolutions.

After the final testing of the website, it is time to test the website in the web environment. After uploading all the web files to the server, the latest testing of the functionality of the website is performed.
